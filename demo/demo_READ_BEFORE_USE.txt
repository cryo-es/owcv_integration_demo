If you're opening this in Notepad:
It's easier to read with Word Wrap enabled.
Click Format > Word Wrap.

Before running the exe for the first time:
Open config.ini and toggle off any features you don't want.

Settings you might want to change:
BEEP_ENABLED = False (disables the debug beep each time vibe intensity changes, some may want this on)
USING_INTIFACE = True (enables the connection to Intiface, leave it as False if you want to test without a toy)
PLAYING_MERCY = False (if you're not planning to play Mercy, set to False for better performance)
SCREEN_WIDTH = 2560 (if your monitor is 2560x1440, or set some other value as per your monitor)
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 1440 (if your monitor is 2560x1440, or set some other value as per your monitor)

Notes:
This started out as a prototype/demo that I threw together in an afternoon, but I've been sucked into it so it's becoming a fully-fledged project now. New name and repo soon!

Known Issues:
- Bugginess at resolutions other than 1920x1080. I'm looking into it.
- High latency to the game server causes Mercy's beam to reconnect to people slower when switching types. This can cause temporary gaps in vibration.
- Detecting resurrect in Kiriko ult probably won't work.
- Only works on Windows.
