If you're opening this in Notepad:
It's easier to read with Word Wrap enabled.
Click Format > Word Wrap.

Before running the exe for the first time:
Open config.ini and toggle off any features you don't want.

Settings you might want to change:
BEEP_ENABLED = False (disables the debug beep each time vibe intensity changes, some may want this on)
USING_INTIFACE = True (enables the connection to Intiface, leave it as False if you want to test without a toy)
PLAYING_MERCY = False (if you're not planning to play Mercy, set to False for better performance)
SCREEN_WIDTH = 2560 (if your monitor is 2560x1440, or set some other value as per your monitor)
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 1440 (if your monitor is 2560x1440, or set some other value as per your monitor)

Notes:
This is very much just a prototype/demo, I threw the vibrator part of this together in an afternoon
It's mainly to give people in Furi's server something to play with and also I guess to demonstrate an example of integrating with my OW2 CV project

Known Issues:
- Fails to launch if Intiface's server is not running
- Crashes shortly after launch if you don't have a device connected to Intiface (probably)
- Resolutions other than 1920x1080 probably don't work (templates/masks need to be scaled)
- Detecting resurrect in Kiriko ult probably won't work
- Operating systems other than Windows probably won't work
- Might have a performance impact
- High latency to the game server causes Mercy's beam to reconnect to people slower when switching types. This can cause temporary gaps in vibration.
